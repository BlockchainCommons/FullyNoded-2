        FullyNoded 2 is a professional mobile wallet built using the most up-to-date technologies for Bitcoin. It's focused on three goals that together demonstrate some of the best practices for modern mobile-wallet design:

        1. **Self-sovereign Interactions.** Classic mobile wallets usually talked to a full node chosen by the wallet developer and owned/controlled by someone else. FullyNoded 2 instead allows you to choose a full node, either one created using a setup process such as #BitcoinStandup and run by yourself, or a service offered by a provider that you select: self-sovereign means you get to decide. (You can use Blockchain Commons' full-node server for beta testing, but you should migrate to a protected server for real money transactions.)

        2. **Protected Communications.** All of the communications in FullyNoded 2 are protected by the latest version of Tor, which provides two-way authentication of both the server and your wallet. Unlike traditional use of the soon to be deprecated SPV protocol, which reveals that you're accessing the Bitcoin network, Tor simply shows that you're engaging in private onion communications. It's safer when you're in a hostile state, and it's safer in your local coffee shop.

        3. **Multi-sig Protections.** Finally, FullyNoded 2 ensures that your private keys are protected from the most common adversary: loss. Its 2-of-3 multi-sig system leaves one key on the server, one on your mobile wallet, and one in safe off-line storage. If you lose your phone or your server, you can still rebuild from the other two. (The Blockchain Commons #SmartCustody system talks more about how to protect off-line keys.)

        FullyNoded 2 is intended for a sophisticated power user. It's a leading-edge platform that experiments with modern Bitcoin technologies to create a powerful new architecture with features not found in other mobile wallets. It's intended as a professional wallet for your use and also as a demonstration of functionality that other companies can integrate into their own apps as an open source reference implementation of functionality.

        Even more cutting-edge technology is planned for the future, including collaborative custody models, airgapped technologies such as Blockchain Commons' #LetheKit for offline signing using QR codes, and methodologies for social-key recovery.

        Once FullyNoded 2 connected, using it is straightforward:

        * To spend Bitcoin just tap the "Out" button.

        FullyNoded 2 runs a Tor node which it uses to connect to your nodes V3 hidden service over the onion network. This way you can privately and securely control your nodes wallet functionality remotely from anywhere in the world, allowing you to keep your node completely behind a firewall with no port forwarding required. The app uses a lot of security minded features to avoid any sensitive info being recorded to your devices memory regarding the Tor traffic. Clearnet traffic is strictly disabled, the Tor config settings excludes exit nodes from your Tor circuit meaning it will only ever interact with the Tor network.

        FullyNoded 2 uses powerful encryption to secure your your nodes hidden service urls and private keys. Initially a private key is created which is stored on your devices keychain which is itself encrypted. That private key is used to decrypt/encrypt the apps sensitive data. Whenever your device goes into the background all the apps data becomes encrypted yet again. No sensitive info is ever stored unencrypted or transmitted over the internet in clear text. All Tor traffic is highly encrypted by default.

        FullyNoded 2 utilizes the latest generation of hidden services and allows you to take advantage of Tor V3 authentication, meaning your device is capable of producing a private/public key offline where you may upload the public to your node to ensure that your device is the only device in the world that can access your node EVEN IF an attacker managed to get your nodes hidden service url. This means of authentication is particularly handy if you want to share your node with trusted others, ensuring only they have access. This is possible because you as the user never have access to the private key used for authentication, so even if users share their public keys with an attacker it would be useless to them. To be clear the way it works is FullyNoded will create the ultra secret private key, encrypt it and store it locally, it then get decrypted when the Tor node starts up, whenever your app goes into the background the private key is deleted from your Tor config, the file the private key is saved on is also maximally protected by native iOS encryption on top of a secondary layer of encryption we give it, you as theuser will never see or have access to the private key and without that private key no device or attacker can possibly get access to your nodes hidden service. Of course there may be attack vectors we are not aware of and it is important you do your own research and look at the codebase if you are curious.
