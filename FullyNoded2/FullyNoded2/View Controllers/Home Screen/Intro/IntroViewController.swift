Founded to support blockchain infrastructure & the broader security industry through cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, research, and standards.\n\nPlease consider supporting us via BTCPayServer here \n\nPlease see our website for more info at blockchaincommons.com\n\nAnd the GitHub which includes the source code and detailed information.\n\nFullyNoded 2 is tailor made to work with Bitcoin Core and works especially well with the MacOS StandUp.app and the StandUp.sh Linux scripts. You may also pair this app over Tor by scanning the QR code your BTCPayServer, RaspiBlitz, Nodl, or MyNode produce."

Of course you may do this yourself by following the instructions on our github.\n\nThe app will then do all the hard work for you. Using FullyNoded 2 is straightforward, to create a Bitcoin invoice just tap the \"In\" button, to spend Bitcoin just tap the \"Out\" button. For advanced users you can tap the list button for full coin control.\n\nGo to settings to export your seed and for wallet recovery information.\n\nAuthenticate your connection to your node with the public key you can export in settings."

This way you can privately and securely control your nodes wallet functionality remotely from anywhere in the world, allowing you to keep your node completely behind a firewall.\n\nThe unique architecture of FullyNoded 2 means that you can use BIP39 recovery phrases with your Bitcoin Core node whilst keeping your node cold and storing the private keys in a more secure way on your device.\n\nFullyNoded 2 automatically creates a seed locally on your device and encrypts it.\n\nIt then creates a dedicated \"StandUp\" wallet on your node, importing your xpub to create a watch-only wallet on your node.\n\nIt stores your seed locally so it can derive the necessary private keys on demand to sign raw transactions before broadcasting them. To back up your wallet simply go to \"Wallets\" and tap \"Export Seed\", to recover your wallet use the Wallet Recovery Commands with any Bitcoin Core node console."

You will need to export the public key to your nodes hidden service \"authorized_clients\" directory which is simple to do with either MacOS StandUp.app or the StandUp.sh Linux scripts.\n\nThat's it! Tap the back button or the home button to get started."
